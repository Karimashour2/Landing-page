            It took hundreds of researchers and many telescopes to capture an image 
            of the black hole at the middle of our Milky Way.
            The first image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the milky way
            sagittarius a star was just released by astronomers. Technically, black holes are unseeable. 
            They trap all light that falls in. That's why photographing one is sort of a paradox.
            This is actually a picture of the black hole's shadow—a dark 
            circular silhouette set against the glowing matter surrounding the black hole.
            The astronomers captured the image using a worldwide network of radio observatories 
            called the Event Horizon Telescope, or the EHT.
            The EHT uses a method called Very Long Baseline Interferometry, or VLBI.
            Basically this means that radio observatories around the world
            combine into a single virtual Earth-sized telescope.
            It's literally the highest resolution technique in all of astronomy. 
            In April 2017, astronomers spent nights pointing these telescopes in unison at 
            Sagittarius A* and other supermassive black holes in other galaxies.
